# How to Get more Fine-grained Information of a Dataset?


Fine-grained analysis aims to answer the question: **what are the characteristics of a dataset?**
Conceptually, each data point (i.e. sample-level) or whole dataset (i.e. dataset-level) can be characterized from different dimensions.
These are either generic (`text length` at sample-level or `the average text length` at corpus-level) or task-specific
(for summarization: `summary compression` `the average of summary compression`)
